# Food Recommendation 

This challenge is to find user food preference based on historical data.

You will be asked to predict the possibility of a user ordering a food item based on historical data. 
The train and the test data are selected from users order history in a given time period. The train and test datasets are split based on time, and the test set split time period comes after training set split time period. It is recomended for 80-20 split where 80% of data is used in training and 20% of data is used in testing.

We will use a seperate dataset at our end to evaluate your model.
